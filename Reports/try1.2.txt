---- 1.2 (Alpha) ----
* Completely refactored the source code.
* Have made just 1 struct.
* Have made an object for each blocks (uploader,customer and line).
* It allows true memory allocating within wrong adresses .
* It reads all values from text and put them into completely wrong adresses.

** It has printing code lines in it for the first time and all of information of text file but doesnt works.
** Tried to make functions which can calculate line length but not finished.
** I got extremely bored so I though teachers may be bored so decided to make a credit for my homework.

*** source code prints and returns nothing , completely doesnt work. :)
